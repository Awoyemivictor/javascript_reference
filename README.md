# JavaScript Reference
-- The JavaScript reference serves as a repository of facts about the JavaScript language.
The entire language is described in detail. As you write JavaSCript code, you'll refer to these
pages often (thus the title "JavaScript reference").

The JavaScript language is intended to be used within some larger environent, be it a browser,
server-side scripts, or similar. For the most part, this reference attempts to be environent-
agnostic and does not target a web browser environment.
